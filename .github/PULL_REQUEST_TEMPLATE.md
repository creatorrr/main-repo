## Guidelines

 1. **IMPORTANT** If an issue does not already exist for the change you are making, please create one first.
 2. You have done your changes in a separate branch. Branches MUST have descriptive names that start with either the `fix/` or `feature/` prefixes. Good examples are: `fix/signin-issue` or `feature/issue-templates`.
 3. You have a descriptive commit message with a short title (first line).
 4. Your pull request MUST NOT target the `master` branch on this repository. You probably want to target `staging` instead.
 5. Make sure to use and run any githooks defined in the `.githooks` folder of the repository.
